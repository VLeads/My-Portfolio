                <p style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bolder;
                color: green;">“Branch”</span> is not an unfamiliar word. It is too common to hear the words such
                    as the branch of a tree, branch of a bank, a branch of science, etc. We use them quite often in our
                    lives. Today, you will link another meaning to the word “branches” in your already existing
                    vocabulary. This new type of branch is Git Branch.</p>







                <p style="font-size: large;">In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git
                    branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature
                    or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
                </p>

                <div class="container container-center">
                    <img class="hero-img" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-branch.png"
                        alt="Git Branch">

                </div>

                <p style="font-size: large;">
                    This makes it harder for
                    unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your
                    future's history before merging it into the main branch.
                </p>




                <p style="font-size: large;">In a collaborative environment, it is common for several developers to
                    share and work on the same
                    source code. While some developers will be fixing bugs, others will be implementing new features,
                    etc. With so much going on, there needs to be a system in place for managing different versions of
                    the same code base.

                    Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work
                    from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on !!</p>

                <p style="font-size: large;">I too, learned about Git while studying and writing about this. Thankyou !!</p>
